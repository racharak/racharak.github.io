*   Artificial intelligence bootcamp at Thai Programmer Association & Software Park Thailand
    *    **Objectives:** Overview the state-of-the-art technologies related to artificial intelligence (AI) with the 
    primary focus on machine learning techniques. Students will learn about best practices in AI and experience 
    the development using widely-used technologies and tools (e.g. Tensorflow and Octave).

Preparation:
*   Follow this [link](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) to install python development environment on your system. 
Following are some important notes:
    *   Requires Python 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6. Type 'python --version' on your command prompt to verify your installed python.
    *   Creates a virtual environment to isolate package installation. Conda may be used to create one, if preferred. 
    *   Install TensorFlow packages in the created virtual environment i.e. 'pip install --upgrade tensorflow'
    *   For rolling back Python 3.7 to 3.6, you may see this [link](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/329187/homebrew-rollback-from-python-3-7-to-python-3-6-5-x)
*   Follow this [link](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html) to download and install the software. 
    *   For Mac users, you can use 'brew install octave' to install the command-line version. Or, see 
    [this link](https://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_macOS) for more detailed information. 
    *   For Windows users, you can install using the installer provided on the web page (i.e. 'octave-4.4.1-w64-installer.exe')
*   Download and install [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
    *   Though Pycharm is recommended, any preferred IDE can be used.
