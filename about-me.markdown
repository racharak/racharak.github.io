I am a PhD student in the school of Information Science, [Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology](http://www.jaist.ac.jp/){:target="_blank"} (JAIST) (Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan) and in the school of Information, Computer, and Communication Technology  (ICT), [The Sirindhorn International Institute of Technology](http://www.siit.tu.ac.th/newsite/){:target="_blank"} (SIIT) (Pathum Thani, Thailand).

My research interests involve Artificial Intelligence, particularly in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning using 
diverse formalisms (e.g. [Description Logics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Description_logic){:target="_blank"} and [Argumentation Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_framework){:target="_blank"}). I deal with 
problems ranging from theoretical aspects, i.e. Logic and its application to Formal semantics, to empirical development, e.g. Knowledge-based applications.

Fortunately, not only having academic contributions, I am also interested in social activities for software development solutions. Being an open-minded software engineer, I have joined Agille66 community and Thai Programmer networks and help organising conferences in the free time.
